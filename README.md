# mcdonalds_countries

R program that takes data from Wikipedia and creates a gif displaying when McDonald's moved to certain countries

This project was originally inspired by Tomas Westlake and his country map for the burger king pandemic

The code was written by Eric Sun, with Tomas Westlake's code being used as a template/guide to help me understand certain R functions. Some of the code is taken directly from his blog (used with his permission). 

To run the code, either run it with R or using RStudio (recommended). The program will create an animation.gif which can be found in the same folder that the code is stored in.
